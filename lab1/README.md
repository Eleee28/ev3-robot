# Lab 1 - Driving in a Square

## Overview
Learn how to drive the EV3 robot in a square pattern.

## Objectives
Understand how to drive the EV3 robot using the motor classes.

## Content
In this lab we are just going to use the robot motors. We want to use only motor controls to navigate the robot in a square.
In order to turn the robot we are going to engage either just one or both wheels. E.g. if only one wheel is turning, the robot will turn around the static wheel. Also, if the two wheels move at different rates, the robot will turn in a direction depending on which wheel is moving faster.

Using Move Tank from the Motor class try to make the robot travel in a square.
- Using trial and error
- Using one wheel motor to turn, keeping the other static
- Using two wheel motors to turn
