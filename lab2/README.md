# Lab 2 - Using Gyroscope and Touch Sensor

## Overview
Learn how to drive the EV3 robot in other pattern shapes.

## Objectives
Understand how to drive the EV3 robot using the motor classes.

## Content
In this lab we are going to use the gyroscope and touch sensor.
1. Make the robot travel in a square, this time using the gyroscope to measure the angle of turn.
2. Use the gyroscope to make the robot travel in a circle, stopping after making one complete circle. Make the robot rotate on the stop and travel in a circle and compare the results of rotation.
3. Use the touch sensor to initiate reversing the robot after hitting a wall. After reversing, turn 180 degrees.
